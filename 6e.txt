This assessment is not to determine the maturity of a process but if a business process or a technical process can be transitioned to an out-sourcing company with the security posture staying intact during and after the transition. Without understanding the four aspects of a process, you will not be able to adjust it to the new outsourcing situation. You might even discover that a process might not require any adjustment. To get a complete view of the overall picture, it is suggested to use a spread-sheet as shown in Figure 4.4. The rating of zero to five has been chosen arbitrarily. A rating of zero to three could also be chosen, depending on how granular the results of the assessment need to be. Color-coding the ratings can help to present the results to upper management.
